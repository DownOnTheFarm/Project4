Principal component analysis (PCA) 
is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability 
but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated 
variables that successively maximize variance.

What is Variance Ratio?
Variance ratio or co-efficient of dispersion is defined as the ratio of variance to mean. 
It is defined only for those models, where the mean is non zero. 
It is frequently used with exponential and Poisson distribution for count data etc.
